UX:
For better readability i would switch the order of text and image as readers are drawn from left to right and your hero text is more important than the image (image 1 and 2) (here i also added clamping to the width of the hero section so it doesn't span to far on bigger screens)

For readability i would differentiate the buttons in the card text. (image 3 and 4)

Personal opinion:
The glow effect on the image, call to action, and project cards are distracting and would be better suited to a color-block shadow like your section divider.

There's too little space between about, projects, and contact. (image 5 and 6)
